A scrum poker planning app developed in swift by me

## Installing / Getting started

Just open and run on Xcode

I've used Xcode 9.x, Swift 3.0 and an iPhone7 to run this project.
If you're planning to run it on XCode 10+ please be aware that a migration to Swift 4+ will be necessary.

## Developing

### Languages
Swift Language v3 and UIKit for the GUI. 

## Licensing

MIT
